## "Utopia"
September 1 XXXX
Utopia: An imagined community or society that possesses highly desirable or nearly perfect qualities for its citizens. Guess it's no longer imagined since Earth has become a utopia, if you can believe that, after Covid-19 struck. Life got a lot more interesting to say the least,now everyone has a curfew and if you break it, you're shot on sight and Earth suddenly decided to change the genre and go full on fantasy. XXX years ago, our children started developing supernatural abilities and we created a new system, the higher your power, the higher your rank and the more privilege that comes with it. I like how I call it new,but it's really just a revamp of the old education system.

My parents are one of many with subpar abilities, however, they got lucky and gave birth to my talented sister, she was gifted with one of the strongest powers and fame and power came with that. My parents work at a government lab that is trying to harness the powers of the strongest people and artificially create the strongest human alive. Like I said, I was a problem child, my abilities are only B on the spectrum but what I do have is a high IQ, thus forcing me to work in all sorts of government posts. My newest job is actually experiencing life at my sister's school or more like monitoring her abilities. Naturally, she goes to the most prestigious schools and while the typical cost of tuition would be millions, she got in on a scholarship.

I already knew the type of people I would meet there, there are only two- bratty rich kids and overpowered children with no control. I was used to the stares of distaste and disgust as I walked down the halls, I know they looked down on me but they would never dare to try harming me. I lived in the hostel there but I come back to the house on the weekends. The lessons taught there mostly consist of the theory of abilities,some history and whole lot of battles. Despite the rigorous curriculum they have there, I know they would never last a day outside that school, especially with their lack of life skills and common sense.

## My Beloved Sister
"Hey #@$%#@!" yelled my annoying roommate- Emily. Just as I took off my earpiece, I prepared myself for dissapointment and whole lot of self control. Rolling my eyes, I turn towards Emily, ready for another exciting outburst and shrieking. "What is it now...if you're gonna talk to me about my sister,don't." I dragged, annoyed.After hearing that, it was almost as if I could see the second all the excitement in her face get drained, reminds me of a puppy-cute. Emily kinda reminds my of the boot- licking suck ups at my school, except she's too dumb to think of using me. Despite my monotone, I was honestly surprised that my sister had got into another fight. She wasn't stupid, she knew it would do her no good if she starts getting demerit points for her misconduct but she's still too young, too naive, too gullible, too impulsive, that's why she has me, her lovable sister that will straighten her up.

I made my way to the colloseum, where all duels took place. As I took my place, I crunched down the popcorn I had bought and think about the perpetual demise of the boy she was fighting. Honestly, I don't know why I even bother coming when I know she'll decimate him in seconds, she should just get it over with. With dust that threatens to leave me blind gushing towards the audience,everyone knew that the victor of this fight had been decided. As she wipes the glistening sweat off her forehead, she is somehow able to captivate everyone with her beauty despite how sweaty and probably putrid she smells, I mean...that's just Heather-the perfect girl.

As she looks up the colloseum presumably looking at me, she wore a certain smugness on her face and confidence in her stride. She probably expects me to cheer for her like every other student at this school. As I made my way out the colloseum, Heather is somehow able to catch up to me and contrary to my previous statement, she smells as fresh as roses,no wonder I could never stand roses. "So what's the reason for this fight?" I ask already knowing the answer, "The same as all the others," she replies with a slightly angry undertone. "Wow thanks for caring for me and protecting me from all the slander sis," I say sarcastically. This was when my sister got really angry,she always hates it when I don't take the "bullying" I get at school seriously, why does she think I do it.

## Sane Parents
After walking back to the dorms, we split into our respective buildings. She gets to live in her personal mansion with all the other talented individuals while I stay in an apartment, though I like it better this way. I shower and eat dinner before making my way back to my office where I record all the data I've received from my sister's monitors. The government sees my sister as a very valuable specimen and she might get her reawakening anytime soon. Her emotions have been fluctuating lately and her tendency to be reckless is getting worse. After crunching all the numbers and data together, my eyes started drooping and my lolling head hovers above my desk. After finally succumbing to my exhaustion, I lie on my bed ready to sleep and dream of cussing the entire universe.

Reawakening: A natural occurrence that happens when someone experiences near the peak of their puberty. Teenagers' already existing abilities will increase in all areas or in rare cases teenagers may change their inherent ability

"Whoosh!" I hear the curtains. Just as I was drifting off into my sleep, some uninvited visitors decided to show up in my room. At that point, I was too tired to deal with anything at 3am, I simply stared at them unbothered and said "Ask whoever who sent you here to find me tommorrow, just say I was too tired to deal with them, " as I put the covers over me and tried to doze off.

The last I remember was getting lifted up by the strangers and just giving up on trying to resist. I was now stuck in a digusting room filled with cobwebs, dust and vines growing from the leaking pipes. As the water is getting creepily close to dripping on me, I get escorted to a blank room enclosed with 4 walls and a door.There I meet my psychotic parents. "What a warm welcome I'm getting, really feeling the love!"I announce smirking. My parents merely shrugged it off and gave me a look. I know that they want the data about my sister, I mean she is their main source of income, gotta make sure she's doing well. I feel bad for my sister,having such an awful family, we all just use her when necesary and treat her as a puppet that's stringed around.

## Threats
After getting the information they wanted of my sister, I was sent back to the dorms at 7am, right when classes start urgh...Honestly, I'll just ditch, who cares about truancy when you can sleep. "Wake up #@$%#@! The gamemasters are interested in you. " my dokbi said. "Really...again, I already said I don't want to get involved, why don't they just go for my sister, " I commented indifferently. "You know how they feel about your sister" my dokbi replied.

Dokbi: Unknown creatures that follow select humans and hold "live streams" for gamemasters
Gamemasters: Beings similar to gods that sponser humans they're interested in

Little history lesson: The same time that humans started developing abilities, creatures from an unknown dimension started appearing and the chaos that unfolded decimated half of Earth's population. Fortunately, the humans that survived were able to strike a deal with those creatures. Ever since then, we've coexisted. However, part of that deal was that dokbi are able to "live stream" us without us knowing for the entertainment of the otherworldly beings. And if you're lucky, gamemasters may take an interest in you and sponser you by giving you their traits and skills as well as allowing you to purchase objects that are beyond human scope, such as: life saving elixers, weapons that can wipe out a continent and even immortality.

As expected,the gamemasters hate my sister. There really is no reason, I suppose they just don't fancy her personality. Unlike my sister, dokbi and gamemasters have been vying for my attention for as long as I've been conscious of the world. They always offer me sponserships that could allow me to live my entire life without even lifting a finger, yet I've never once accepted. Ungrateful I know. That's why they're still interested in me, gamemasters have a strong sense of pride and having me- who has never cared for gamemasters to accept their offer has the same feeling as us scoring full marks while every one else failed.

As I continue to ignore that loud chattering box of a dokbi, I notice the monitors of my sister flashing red and then suddenly, everything went into silence.It was like everything had stopped, time wasn't moving, oxygen seemed to disappear and a blackout happened. When everything seemed to come back to normal, only mere seconds passed but it felt like I was stuck there for an eternity. The monitors showing my sister's power levels were increasing and decreasing at dangerously high rates and her emotions fluctuated like one of a mental patient, if she wasn't stopped soon, her body would not be able to withstand the toil its taking and would just completely shut down.

Using the GPS tracker on my sister,I rushed to her location-the school hall.There was currently a assembly happening so that meant that her power burst was gonna a lot of people-this is gonna cost a lot of money to cover up.When I entered the school,it was desolute,unlike the usual crowd of students making their way to their classes,the pristine hallways were empty, filled with burn marks and ash,the ceilings and walls were collapsing while burning aflame.This was worse than I thought.I moved towards the hall, dodging the debris falling and try not to inhale the heavy amount of smoke.When I reached the hall, all the students had already escaped, thankfully, my sister seemed to have passed out from exhaustion but that didn't stop her power from leaking out.I had to put on special protective gear and picked her up bridal style,she was running a high fever and her body was on the verge of breaking,if she can't let out discharge soon,her body will redirect all the sudden energy towards her.

I brought her to my lab located under the school and started examining her,I tried almost all the machines but nothing worked.Her body refused to regulate properly and if I tried to force the discharge out of her,the effects would be worse than an atomic bomb.I had one machine that could work,but it was still a prototype and the moment she's put into the capsule,I don't know if she'll wake up.As I was frying my brains out thinking of a solution, my sister was getting worse and worse, her monitors were going berserk.At that point, I was out of solutions and out of time, I carefully lifted her and put her in the capsule and started the process of channeling her excess energy.

## The Consequences
To say the least,the government is not hoing to be happy with this development and I'm not going to be happy of all the overtime I need to do to make up for this.
